## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

Its a simple food recipe appication which helps users get the recipe information about the meal inputed.
I'm using the API call to get all the infomation i need about the food recipe request, i also want to filter through the array and make the returned data a link to view the Recipe.
